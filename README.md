# USYD Report Template
Custom USYD LaTeX template for reports/assignments.

This comes with a preamble file pre-loaded with many common packages, a custom title page and a document pre-set out.

Change authors, titles, subjects etc. with all the hard yards of finding a decent looking package already done!

## Using this with Overleaf:
Download the repository as a .zip file. In Overleaf, click "New Project" -> "Upload Project" and upload the .zip file. This will create a new file using the template above.

## Using this with local LaTeX installations:
Simply unzip the file in the chosen directory and begin typing away!
